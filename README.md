# 🍅 Pomodoro Desktop App

## About

I’m building a Pomodoro app because I love the Pomodoro Technique and wanted a desktop version for myself. It’s also a great way to improve my coding skills. 

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into 25-minute intervals with short breaks. Developed by Francesco Cirillo, it helps boost productivity and focus. ⏳

## Features

- **Timer:** Counts down from 25 minutes (or any time you set).
- **Breaks:** Short breaks between intervals. 🧘‍♂️
- **Customization:** Adjust work and break times to fit your needs. ⚙️
- **Notifications:** Alerts when work or break time is up. 🔔

## Why This Project?

- **Personal Use:** I wanted a Pomodoro timer for my desktop that matches my workflow. 
- **Learning Opportunity:** It’s a chance to practice my programming skills, especially in desktop apps. 

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JS, Electron**
